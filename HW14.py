#1. Create a while loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 0 and then prints
#"Hello World!" at the end.
i = 5
while i >= 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1
else:
    print("Hello World")
#2. Create a while loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 30 (HINT: modulo).
j = 1
while j <= 30:
    if j % 2 == 0:
        print(j)
    j += 1
print("------------------------------------------------------------------------")
#3. Create a while loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the
#number is divisible by 3.
k = 1
while k <= 30:
    if k % 3 != 0:
        print(k)
    k += 1
#4. Create a while loop that randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, prints the result,
#and then breaks the loop if it's a 1.
m = random.randint(1, 6)
while m != 1:
    print(m)
    m = random.randint(1, 6)

#5. Create a while loop that asks for a number input until the user inputs the number 0.

num_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))
while num_input != 0:
    num_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))
